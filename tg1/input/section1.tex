\section{Basic understanding}
\label{sec:section1}

This section tries to give the reader a basic understanding of cardiac physiology, the procedures involved in acquiring electrical activity from the heart, as well as the irregularities produced in the ECG by ischemic heart disease.

\subsection{How the heart works}

\subsection{Electrocardiogram signals}

\subsection{Ischemic effects on the ECG}


In the remaining part of this paper, we shall discuss the three algorithms implemented.
