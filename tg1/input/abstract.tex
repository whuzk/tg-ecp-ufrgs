    This work presents a study in which three algorithms for detection of ischemic episodes in electrocardiograms were implemented and evaluated. The algorithms were first implemented in MATLAB source code, then individually tested for their capability in detecting actual ischemic patterns, and, finally, compared to each other in terms of how well they perform in a simulated cardiac monitoring setting. The purpose of this work is, therefore, to select the best method that can be used in a real cardiac monitoring system with support for medical decision-making.
